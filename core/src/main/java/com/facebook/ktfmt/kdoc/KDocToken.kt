   * indentation, forcing or forbidding whitespace) from [KDocWriter] gets its own type. But I
   * haven't been super careful about it, so I'd imagine that we could merge or remove some of these
   * if we wanted. (For example, PARAGRAPH_CLOSE_TAG and LIST_ITEM_CLOSE_TAG could share a common
   * IGNORABLE token type. But their corresponding OPEN tags exist, so I've kept the CLOSE tags.)
   *
   * Note, though, that tokens of the same type may still have been handled differently by [ ] when
   * it created them. For example, LITERAL is used for both plain text and inline tags, even though
   * the two affect the lexer's state differently.
