- Dot-qualified scoping functions (e.g., `scope.launch { }`) now format as block-like expressions, consistent with non-qualified calls ([GH#205](https://github.com/facebook/ktfmt/issues/205))
- Backtick-escaped full-path imports are no longer incorrectly removed as unused (https://github.com/facebook/ktfmt/issues/532)

- Blank lines before lists and blockquotes in KDoc comments are now preserved (https://github.com/facebook/ktfmt/issues/561)
